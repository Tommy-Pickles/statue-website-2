    <p class="arial">Now we are hyped to do it again but bigger. Doge Day is going to be a celebration of the life and times of Kabosu. There will be food, entertainment, surprises and very special guests. It will be a global media event, and we want you at the party. We are looking for sponsors and VIPs to join a group of the biggest Doge heads in the world. The day itself will be free to the public, and a family friendly affair, but we’re building an epic VIP Ticket Package for only the Dogeliest.</p>
